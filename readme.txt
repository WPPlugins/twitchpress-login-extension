Launch your own Twitch services using the TwitchPress plugin for WordPress.
                       
== Description ==

Add Twitch social login and registration to your TwitchPress service. This plugin acts as an extension
to TwitchPress and has no purpose on it's own. The required API class and configuration exists in the
core TwitchPress plugin. This helps to keep extensions simple. 

If you require more social login options and not just Twitch. You can install any social plugin and 
provide more options for your visitors. You can still use this extension to ensure that your users
profiles are populated with the values your TwitchPress service needs.

== Version Numbers and Updating ==

Explanation of versioning used by myself Ryan Bayne. The versioning scheme I use is called "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0" and more
information about it can be found at http://semver.org/ 

These are the rules followed to increase the TwitchPress plugin version number. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
